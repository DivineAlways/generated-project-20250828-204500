# Project: Misty Waters - Personal Portfolio Website

This project package contains all the assets for a single-page portfolio website for Misty Waters, a Generative AI Engineer. The goal is to create a clean, professional, and responsive site to showcase her skills, projects, and contact information.

## Project Structure

- **/index.html**: The main project hub, linking to all other parts.
- **/docs/**: Contains all markdown-based documentation, including the project overview, requirements, and user flows.
- **/wireframes/**: Low-fidelity HTML wireframes that outline the structure and layout of the website.
- **/prototype/**: A high-fidelity, interactive, and data-driven prototype built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a fully functional simulation of the final website.
